# HTMLandCSS_buttons
Some popular buttons of different website and social media that I tried as a practice.

The file named buttons have the buttons, one is the "Subscribe" button from youtube, second is a "Join" button and the third is the "Tweet" button.

The file named excercisebuttons have two buttons "Add to cart" and "Buy now" from Amazon.
